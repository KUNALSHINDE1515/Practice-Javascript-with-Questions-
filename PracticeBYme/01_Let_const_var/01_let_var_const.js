// Basic Declaration and Initialization:

// Declare a variable named firstName and assign your first name to it.

let firstName;
firstName = "kunal shinde";
console.log(firstName);
// Declare a variable named age and initialize it with your current age (as a number).
// Create a variable named isStudent and set it to true if you are a student, or false otherwise.
// Declare a variable favouriteColor and leave it uninitialized for now.



// Variable Naming and Case Sensitivity:

// What are the valid characters for naming variables in JavaScript? Can you use spaces or special characters?
// Is JavaScript case-sensitive for variable names? Demonstrate with an example.
// Explain the difference between firstName, FirstName, and FIRSTNAME in JavaScript.




// Data Types and Scope:

// Declare a variable named height to store your height in meters (as a decimal number). What data type would you use?
// Create a variable fullName that combines firstName and lastName (assuming lastName is already declared).
// Using the let keyword, declare a variable course inside a function named getCourse. Can this variable be accessed outside the function? Why or why not?
// Explain the difference between var, let, and const in terms of scope and mutability.



// Variable Reassignment and Best Practices:

// Change the value of favouriteColor to "blue" using reassignment.
// Explain why using const is generally preferred over let for variables whose values won't change.
// List some best practices for naming variables in JavaScript to improve code readability.



// Bonus Challenge:

// Create an array named fruits to store your favorite fruits. Initialize it with at least three fruit names.
// Access and print the second element of the fruits array.
// Add a new fruit to the end of the fruits array.
// Remember to use an online JavaScript console or a code editor to experiment with these practice questions. You can find resources for setting up a JavaScript development environment online.


// Additional Tips:

// Use descriptive variable names that reflect their purpose.
// Avoid using reserved keywords in JavaScript for variable names (e.g., if, else, for).
// Consider using constants (const) when the value won't change throughout the program.
// Be mindful of variable scope to prevent unintended conflicts.
// By practicing these concepts and adhering to best practices, you'll gain a solid foundation for working with variables in JavaScript.
